# What the hell is that?

What the hell is that? What is your motto here? 
"Boys, inform on your classmates, save your hide. 
Anything short of that, we're gonna burn you at the stake"? 
Well, gentlemen, when the shit hits the fan, some guys run and some guys stay. 
Here's Charlie facing the fire and there's George hiding in Big Daddy's pocket.
And what are you doing? You're gonna reward George and destroy Charlie.
Because I say you are killing the very spirit this institution proclaims it instills. 

## What a sham.

What a sham. What kind of a show you guys are putting on here today? 
I mean, the only class in this act is sitting next to me, 
and I'm here to tell ya this boy's soul is intact. It's non-negotiable.
You know how I know? Someone here, and I'm not gonna say who, offered to buy it.
Only Charlie here wasn't selling. Sir, you're out of order.
Out of order. I'll show YOU "out of order"! 
You don't know what "out of order" is, Mr. Trask. 
I'd show you, but I'm too old, I'm too tired, I'm too fucking blind.
If I were the man I was five years ago, I'd take a FLAMETHROWER to this place!
Out of order? Who the hell do ya think you're talking to?
I've been around, ya know? There was a time I could see. And I have seen.
Boys like these.

## Baird men.

Baird men. You hurt this boy, you're gonna be Baird bums, the lot of ya.
And Harry, Jimmy, Trent, wherever you are, fuck you too! Stand down, Mr. Slade!
I'm not finished! As I came in here, I heard those words, "Cradle of Leadership".
Well, when the bough breaks, the cradle will fall.
And it has fallen here. It has fallen. Makers of men, Creators of leaders.
Be careful what kind of leaders you're producing here.
I don't know if Charlie's silence here today is right or wrong.
I'm not a judge or jury, but I can tell you this: He won't sell anybody out to buy his future! 
And that, my friends, is called integrity. 
That's called courage. Now that's the stuff leaders should be made of. 
What a shame.

## Crossroads

Now I have come to the crossroads in my life. 
I always knew what the right path was. Without exception, I knew. 
But I never took it. You know why? It was too damn hard. Now here's Charlie.
